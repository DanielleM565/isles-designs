## Milestone 3 / Final PWP Evaluation
I'm basing your PWP Tier eval on your repo at the following point in time: https://github.com/DanielleM565/isles-designs/tree/aa8d2ee31a1816a2fdec4b164528de517902a7ab

Unfortunately it's not possible for me to test your form wiring at this commit since I don't have access to your mail-config.php... but it looks like your form is working perfectly on your live deployment, so that shows that you were able to wire it up successfully - nice job.

Your layout and design choices are attractive and fully responsive, and your content is thoughtful and well done - nice work!  Your code looks great and is done to a high standard. Congrats on a PWP well done. You demonstrate talent with front end work - I encourage you to continue to practice and experiment! I love the [Codrops Blog](https://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) for inspiration and tutorials.

Your Milestone 3/Final Delivery for PWP passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

Your overall passing grade across all of your PWP Milestones is [33/40 points (82.5%)](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/#sample-score).

- Milestone 1 - 20%: Tier III 30(0.2) = 6
- Milestone 2a - 20%: Tier IV 40(0.2) = 8
- Milestone 2b - 10%: Tier IV 40(0.1) = 4
- Milestone 3 - 50%: Tier  III 30(0.5) = 15

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your custom CSS has been loaded twice - once on line 11 and again on line 31.
- I would link the Animate.css library up above your custom CSS - just in case you would like to override their defaults.
- Watch your HTML indentation.
